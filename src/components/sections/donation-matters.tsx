                  Zara and Mofifun didn&apos;t get here on their own. Someone showed up to coach them. A court was
                  open when they needed it. Someone made sure a racket was in their hands before they ever won a
                  single point.

                <p>
                  We&apos;re saying all this because there are more kids just like them out in the world, right now,
                  with the same hunger and the same potential just waiting for their own shot. Zara&apos;s and
                  Mofifun&apos;s story aren&apos;t rare. It&apos;s something we can give to another child if we keep
                  showing up for them.

                    This is what your donation makes possible: it gives a chance to every child out there. Give a
                    child their own court to grow on. Your donation puts a racket in the next child&apos;s hand and a
                    shot at their own story of growth.
